## PARTICLE REPRODUCTION OF SATURN'S SYSTEM

#### Aims
* Create a particle-system representation of Saturn Rings. 
* Use THREE.js as inteface to WebGL.
* Emphasize use of shaders and technologies studied. 
* Summary study on efficiency of application.

##### A well and examples fully documentation si available here: [Three.js](https://threejs.org)

#### Saturn
* Like Jupiter, is a Giant Planet: it’s the second biggest planet of our solar system. 
* It’s largely composed by hydrogen and helium: it’s a gased planet.
* It has 88 moons and 16 rings. These rings are composed by debris and dust.
* It has a revolution period of 29 years and a day of 10 hours.

On this context we apply some semplifications on this enormous system: 
* Saturn is represented with 2 rings and 1 moon, Titan.
* Collisions betweendebrisaretrascured.
* Shapes of Saturn and Titano are rounded as spheres.
